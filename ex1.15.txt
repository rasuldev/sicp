a) 12.15 / 3 = 4.05
(p (sine 4.05))

4.05 / 3 = 1.35
(p (p (sine 1.35)))

1.35 / 3 = 0.45
(p (p (p (sine 0.45))))

0.45 / 3 = 0.15
(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))

0.15 / 3 = 0.05
(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))

Answer: 5 times.

b) Let s be a steps count. Then a/3^s <= 0.1. Hence s >= log_3 10n. Thus, order of growth in space and steps number is \Theta(log n).
